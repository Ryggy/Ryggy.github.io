### Description

The rope physics simulation offers an interactive 2D environment where users can explore the dynamics of ropes and cloth. Users can easily create and cut the rope/cloth in real time, showcasing realistic physics interactions.

Verlet integration is the core numerical technique used in this simulation. 

### Usage Guide

This guide provides an overview of the rope physics simulation, allowing users to create and manipulate ropes and cloth in a 2D simulated environment.

#### General Controls
- **Spacebar**: Pause/Unpause the simulation. 
- **Right Click**: Destroy connections between nodes.

#### Rope Simulation Mode
- **Left Click**: Spawn nodes to create a rope structure. 
- **Shift + Left Click**: Spawn pinned nodes that remain fixed in position. 
- **Left Click + Drag on Selected Node**: Create connections between nodes to form the rope.

#### Cloth Simulation Mode
- **Left Click + Drag**: Create cloth by dragging from the start point to the end point, allowing for flexible cloth structures.
