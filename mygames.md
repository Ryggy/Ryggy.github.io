### Games


#### Fetch Quest

In this project, I served as both a programmer and gameplay designer. I was responsible for designing and implementing the core mechanics for the delivery tasks, as well as developing the scoring system and user interface. My work ensured a smooth and engaging player experience, with particular attention to balancing gameplay elements.


#### A Wizards Tall Tale

They are surrounded by platforms and slime creatures](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMjMyMTM0MS8xMzc1MTAzOS5wbmc=/original/JUDZLP.png)

As a programmer and level designer on this project, I developed the character controller and input system, implemented various special abilities, and crafted the layout for the first level. Additionally, I designed and integrated the scoring and high score system, ensuring a cohesive and challenging gameplay experience.
