### My story

I'm a passionate gameplay programmer based in Brisbane, Australia, currently completing my **Bachelor of Games Development (Programming)** at **SAE Institute**. My journey into game development began with a fascination for video games that quickly grew into a deep-seated desire to not just play, but to understand and create them.

Throughout my studies and personal projects, I've honed my skills in gameplay programming, AI development, procedural generation, and game design. I thrive on the challenge of tackling complex systems and bringing creative ideas to life. My experience spans from developing intricate gameplay mechanics to crafting visually immersive environments, always with a focus on delivering engaging and impactful experiences.

I take great joy in continuously learning and evolving as a developer. Whether it’s diving into a new technology or refining my approach to problem-solving, I’m driven by a commitment to excellence in every project I undertake. The dynamic nature of game development keeps me inspired, and I’m always eager to explore new opportunities that push the boundaries of what games can achieve.

When I’m not working on my projects or studying, I enjoy connecting with fellow developers and gamers who share my passion for the craft. Whether it’s collaborating on a new idea, participating in game jams, or simply discussing the latest trends in gaming, I’m always open to new experiences and collaborations.
