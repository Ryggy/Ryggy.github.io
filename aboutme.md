### My story

From a young age, I was captivated by the magic of video games. This fascination grew into a deep passion for not just playing games, but understanding how they are made. Over the years, I've dedicated myself to mastering the art and science of game development, from programming and design to AI and procedural generation.

Every project I work on is an opportunity to learn something new and to refine my craft. Whether it's developing a new gameplay mechanic, experimenting with AI, or creating visually stunning environments, I’m driven by a desire to create games that leave a lasting impact.

I'm always eager to connect with others who share my passion, whether you're a fellow developer, a gamer, or someone who just loves a good story.
