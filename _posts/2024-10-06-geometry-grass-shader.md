# Grass Geometry Shader: Behind the Scenes of My Custom Implementation

![Grass Shader](https://ryggy.github.io/assets/img/grass.png)

Creating a realistic, dynamic grass shader can elevate the visual quality of a game and add a layer of immersion to the environment. In this post, I'll walk through my journey of developing a grass geometry shader in Unity, highlighting key features, the creation process, and optimization strategies.


## Key Features of the Shader

- **Billboard Grass Blades**: Grass is rendered using billboards formed by a geometry shader. This involves creating two triangles for each grass blade, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to rendering individual blades.
- **Wind Animation**: The shader includes wind distortion, simulating natural grass movement.
- **Randomization for Natural Variation**: Grass blades are varied in height, orientation, and color to achieve a more organic look.
- **Customizable Properties**: Users can modify the grass texture, height, density, and wind strength, making the shader flexible for different environments.

## Inspiration and References

I was inspired by several existing shaders, each with unique features that influenced my design:

1. **Roystan's Grass Shader**  
   - *Wind Animation*: Realistic grass movement based on wind.
   - *Density Control*: Optimizes performance with adjustable grass density.
   - *Height-Based Color Variation*: Grass color varies with terrain height for better blending with the environment.

2. **MinionsArt's Interactive Grass Geometry Shader**  
   - *Advanced Wind Simulation*: Simulates varying wind intensity and direction.
   - *Interactivity*: Grass responds to character movement, bending and swaying as characters pass through.
   - *LOD Techniques*: Reduces rendering complexity for distant grass to maintain performance.

## The Creation Process

### Research and Learning

Before diving into development, I spent time studying grass shaders, particularly those using geometry shaders. Key resources included tutorials from creators like **AJTech2002** and **Roystan**, which provided foundational knowledge on shader development. I also explored **Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** and its shader libraries to streamline the process.

### Shader Design

The shader's main goal was to create grass blades using billboards, which allows for efficient rendering. Here's how the process was structured:

1. **Vertex Shader**: Transforms vertex positions and normals into world space, calculates UV mapping, and applies fog factors.
2. **Geometry Shader**: Generates additional vertices to form billboards for grass blades, applies wind distortion, and randomizes position and rotation for natural variation.
3. **Fragment Shader**: Determines the final color of each blade, handles lighting, and applies transparency and shadow effects.

### Key Properties

The shader exposes several customizable properties through Unity's inspector, allowing end users to tweak various aspects of the grass:

- **Grass Texture**: Users can change the texture applied to the grass blades.
- **Wind Strength and Direction**: Controls the intensity and direction of the wind effect.
- **Grass Density**: A slider allows users to adjust the density of the grass in the scene.
- **Grass Height**: Users can modify the average height of the grass blades.
- **Color Variation**: Grass color can be adjusted to blend with different terrain types.

### Testing Different Styles

### Optimization Strategies

To ensure the shader performs well even in complex environments, I implemented several optimization techniques:

- **Billboard Geometry**: Using billboards for each blade reduces the number of vertices compared to rendering individual grass blades.
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: The shader switches between high and low detail depending on the camera's distance from the grass, improving performance without sacrificing visual quality.
- **Tessellation**: Grass near the camera is tessellated for added detail, while distant grass has reduced tessellation to optimize rendering.
- **Occlusion Culling**: Grass blades that aren't visible to the camera aren't rendered, saving on processing power.

## Future Improvements

While the shader currently performs well (around 500 FPS with 400K vertices), further optimization is necessary for larger scenes with over 1M vertices. I plan to explore additional culling techniques and refine the tessellation process to further reduce vertex count.

This project not only helped me grasp advanced shader development concepts but also showcased the power of optimization in enhancing both visual quality and performance. I look forward to refining this shader and exploring new ways to bring dynamic environments to life in my future projects.
