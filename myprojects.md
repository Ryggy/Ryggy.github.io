#### Procedural Generation

I developed a procedural generation tool designed to create dynamic environments within our game simulation. This tool allows users to generate unique terrains, strategically place trees, and populate landscapes with dinosaurs, all through an intuitive interface.

Utilizing Unity, I implemented key features such as customizable noise parameters for terrain heightmaps, distinct noise maps for tree placement, and simple controls for dinosaur population. My primary goal was to explore the potential of procedural generation, demonstrating how algorithmic techniques can produce varied and immersive gameplay experiences.

#### Boids

I developed a sophisticated Boids simulation, inspired by [Craig Reynolds'](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) original model, to demonstrate flocking behavior through autonomous agents. Utilizing Unity, I implemented key features such as steering behaviors, collision avoidance, and alignment to create realistic interactions among the agents.

My main goal was to dive into emergent behavior and understand how simple rules can lead to complex interactions.

### Rope Physics

I developed a rope physics simulation using Verlet integration for position updates. This project allows users to place and connect nodes to create ropes, and they can even cut the rope to see the physics in action. Itâ€™s a hands-on way to explore how ropes behave under different conditions.

To take it a step further, I also created a cloth simulation that spawns a grid of nodes, showcasing how these principles apply to cloth physics. While understanding the physics was a big part of this project, I also focused on making the user interaction intuitive and engaging, so users can really feel the effects of their actions.

### Grass Geometry Shader


I developed a grass shader using HLSL to deepen my understanding of shaders. By implementing a simplified billboard approach, I achieved dynamic effects like wind distortion, height variation, and gradient color transitions, all contributing to a realistic grass appearance. My main goal was to gain hands-on experience with shader programming and the creative possibilities it offers.
